-- Migration: Create vault materialized view
-- This view aggregates SharePriceChanged events and counts positions per vault
--
-- Description:
-- The vault materialized view provides current state for each vault (term_id, curve_id combination).
-- It sources data from SharePriceChanged events and joins with the position view to count active positions.
--
-- Refresh:
-- SELECT refresh_vault_view();

-- Create vault_type enum
